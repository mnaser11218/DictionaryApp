Welcome to your TypeScript Dictionary, a "web based" Dictionary app built with Typescript. This app is designed similar to a google interface, where the user types in an english word and gets the defintion, phonetics, synonyms, antonyms and sentence examples of the word.

The application fetches the word definitions from the dictionary API: https://dictionaryapi.dev

This app is built with TypeScript, Javascript, HTML, CSS and Bootstrap for styling.
